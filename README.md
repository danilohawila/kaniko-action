# kaniko-action

> [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko)

kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster.

kaniko doesn't depend on a Docker daemon and executes each command within a Dockerfile completely in
userspace.

This enables building container images in environments that can't easily or securely run a Docker daemon,
such as a standard Kubernetes cluster.

This action allow you to build and push a Docker image using Kaniko in GitHub Actions. It's compatible with
the Docker's official actions such as docker/login-action or docker/metadata-action and also support GKE
Workload identity as a keyless authentication method to build and push image to a Google Container registry.

## Usage

### Authentication

If available, this action will provide Docker Credentials to kaniko from `~/.docker/config.json`.

_**Note:** If a `config.json` file is not provided, kaniko will attempt to use other authentication mechanisms such as [workload identity for GKE](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#pushing-to-gcr-using-workload-identity). This is the prefered and recommended method if you are executing this github action into a GKE Cluster, Workload identity provides a keyless authentication
mechanism against the GCR remote registry._

### Example Workflows

To build and push a container image to GitHub Container Registry,

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: docker/metadata-action@v3
        id: metadata
        with:
          images: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}

      - uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Kaniko build & push
          uses: bymarshall/kaniko-action@main
          with:
            push: true
            tags: ${{ steps.metadata.outputs.tags }}
            labels: ${{ steps.metadata.outputs.labels }}
```

To build a docker image and analyze it for potential vulnerabilities, you can export the image to a tarball
and perform a local analysis with trivy or any other compatible container analyzer. If you want to analyze
the image without pushing it, just set `push: false`.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: docker/metadata-action@v3
        id: metadata
        with:
          images: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}

      - uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Kaniko build & push
          uses: bymarshall/kaniko-action@main
          with:
            push: true
            tags: ${{ steps.metadata.outputs.tags }}
            labels: ${{ steps.metadata.outputs.labels }}
            tar_file: image.tar

      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          ignore-unfixed: true
          input: image.tar
          exit-code: 1
          severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
          security-checks: vuln,config
```

## Customizing

### inputs

Following inputs can be used as `step.with` keys:

| Name             | Type    | Default                            | Description                                                                    |
|------------------|---------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `context`        | String  |                                    | Relative folder path to the build context. It must be in the current workspace.|
| `file`           | String  | `Dockerfile`                       | Relative path to the Dockerfile. It must be in the context.                    |
| `push`           | Boolean | true                               | Push the image to the registry. Default to true                                |

| `use_new_run`      | Boolean     | false                           |  Use the experimental run implementation for detecting changes without requiring file system snapshots. In some cases, this may improve build performance by 75%. |

## Build performance

In some cases kaniko image build performance may be less efficient; In order to improve the performance,
you could consider enabling the following settings that can help speed up your build time:

- `cache: true`

  Set this flag as true to opt into caching with kaniko.

- `cache_ttl: duration`

  Cache timeout in hours. Defaults to 12 hours.

- `snapshot_mode: redo`

  You can set this flag to set how kaniko will snapshot the filesystem. Valid options are (full, redo, time).

  Redo mode may be up to 50% faster than "full", particularly if your project has a large number files.

- `use_new_run: true`

  Use the experimental run implementation for detecting changes without requiring file system snapshots. In some cases, this may improve build performance by 75%.

Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: docker/metadata-action@v3
        id: metadata
        with:
          images: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}

      - uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Kaniko build & push
          uses: bymarshall/kaniko-action@main
          with:
            push: true
            tags: ${{ steps.metadata.outputs.tags }}
            labels: ${{ steps.metadata.outputs.labels }}
            cache: true
            cache_ttl: 6h
            snapshot_mode: redo
            use_new_run: true
```
